</head>

<body>
    <pre>
    Write a JavaScript program to create the value of NOR of two given booleans.

    Note: In boolean logic, logical nor or joint denial is a truth-functional operator which produces a result that is the negation of logical or. That is, a sentence of the form (p NOR q) is true precisely when neither p nor q is true - i.e. when both of p and q are false

    Sample Example:

    For x = true and y = false, the output should be logical_Nor(x, y) = false; For x = false and y = false, the output should be logical_Nor(x, y) = true.
